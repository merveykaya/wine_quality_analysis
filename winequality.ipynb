    "There are two datasets that provide information on samples of red and white variants of the Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine. Each sample of wine was rated for quality by wine experts and examined with physicochemical tests. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only data on these physicochemical properties and quality ratings are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). \n",

    "# Drawing Conclusions Using Groupby\n",
    "\n",
    "You're going to investigate 2 questions about this data using pandas' groupby function. \n",
    "Here are tips for answering each question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q1: Is a certain type of wine (red or white) associated with higher quality?\n",
    "For this question, compare the average quality of red wine with the average quality of white wine with groupby. To do this group by color and then find the mean quality of each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q2: What level of acidity (pH value) receives the highest average rating?\n",
    "This question is more tricky because unlike color, which has clear categories you can group by (red and white) pH is a *quantitative* variable without clear categories. However, there is a simple fix to this. `You can create a categorical variable from a quantitative variable by creating your own categories. pandas' cut function let's you \"cut\" data in groups`. Using this, create a new column called acidity_levels with these categories:\n",

    "|Medium:| 50% - 75% of pH values|\n",
    "|Low:| 75% - max pH value|\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the data is being split at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you can get these numbers with pandas' `describe()`! \n",
